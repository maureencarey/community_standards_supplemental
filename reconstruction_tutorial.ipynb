    "> In the COBRA community, usually a distinction is made between a _reconstruction_ and a _model_. A _reconstruction_ represents the bare metabolic network of biochemical reactions that may occur in an organism due to the catalytic action of enzymes encoded in the genome plus some spontaneous reactions. A _model_ is then a specification (or parametrization) of a reconstruction by, for example, defining certain medium conditions, i.e., restricting uptake rates; by fixing the directionality of certain reactions to fit those conditions; and by introducing specific energetic maintenance costs of the organism in those conditions. Other forms of model parametrization exist but these are some typical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is the consensus within the community, however, both the SBML element to encode the metabolic network and the cobrapy class are called _model_. They do not make an explicit distinction between those two representations. Within this tutorial we will therefore loosely call everything a model."
